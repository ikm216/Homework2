Description
This C# program reads a string input from the user, converts it to uppercase, and identifies the most common character in the string.Then prints the most common character along with its count of many occurrence in the string.

How the Program Works
1. The program asks the user to enter a string.
2. The string is converted to uppercase to ensure case insensitivity (e.g., 'a' and 'A' are treated as the same character).
3. The array represents ASCII values is used to count the occurrences of each character.
4. The program iterates through the user input string and counts for each character's ASCII value.
5. The program finds the character with the highest count and prints it along with its occurrences of the string.

Test Cases 
Input: "Hello, World!"
Expected Output:
'L' 3

Input: "A bananna a awe is baal"
Expected Output:
'A' 8
